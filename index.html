         This week we were assigned to work in teams outside in the amphitheater. Our objective was to successfully work as a team to roll a small marble down a couple pipes, that would end up dropping the marble into a small cup. 
     We were given 3-5 pipes that had been cut in half in order for us to look through the top of the pipe to see the marible roll through. We picked a team leader to help stragdisise a plan good enough to help us succeed and finish our task.
     The teamleader told us to let the marible roll down the first few people then run over to the end of the line and hand the pipe to someone without one. We continued this until we got the marible into the cup, which took us over 10 attempts it felt like.
     My team kept dropping the marible becuase they would move to early and the marible would just roll out of the pipe. Once my team finally got the small marible into the little cup, the TA gave us a bigger marible to roll down the pipes. 
     The marible wouldn't fit the pipes because it was to big and kept getting stuck.

        This week in class were had to bring a object from home and recreate it in tinkercad. My object was a number counting thing (I forgot the name of it) but at first I thought it would be a easy object to recreate, but soon after I found out it was harder then expected.
    I spent probably the most time working on the base shape for my number counter. Then I worked on getting the right width that I wanted which was pretty easy. Soon after I worked on getting the right shapes for the numbers and the ring that sticks out of the top.
    I used a mix of two shapes to create the ring becuase the shape never came out correct and it always came out looking weird. The button that you push down in order for it to count numbers was annoying as well, becuase I kept making it too thin or too wide.
    I had a fun time recreating this object but if I could've picked a different object I would switch it for sure.

        This week we worked in groups again but this time it was kinda boring because my group didn't really talk that much. One kid in my group didn't talk at all the whole time he just kept using the box cuter to make random shapes in the cardboard.
    Another kid helped cut one thing then started cuting random stuff like the other kid, then he started making a paper air-plane. Jonah was doing the most work in the group becuase his laptop has all the measurements and instructions but he also didn't really talk.
    How can I help my team if they don't tell me how I can help, I can tell my group doesn't really like working as a group becuase they are all doing their own thing. I feel that my group members are smart but they don't like working with others, which doesn't help me.

        Working on our Rube Goldberg project was fun but was also kinda annoying. Jonah Barty did most if not all of the work while me and the others tried helping, but it still wasn’t as much work as what Jonah did. I helped brainstorm some ideas and helped develop ideas to fix a problem. 
    One kid in our group was on his phone the whole time playing video games instead of helping us. I think I spent more time trying to get him to help us than actually doing something productive. Once we finally got everyone working on something the project started moving fast. 
    We are almost done with our project we just have one more class period to finish adding stuff and to test our final project.

        We finished our project finally and we were just waiting for an opportunity to test it. In the meantime we were just checking everyone’s project, to see what people did differently. We also went into the other class to see their projects and the whole class had some really cool designs. 
    One of my friends in the other class had a counterweight system and it looked really complicated. Another group used a pulley system to lift and lower the car in order to pop the balloon. After checking out other groups we started testing and our project worked pretty well, the second time at least. 
    The first attempt failed because the needle went under the balloon instead of popping it.
