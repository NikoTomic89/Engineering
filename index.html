         This week we were assigned to work in teams outside in the amphitheater. Our objective was to successfully work as a team to roll a small marble down a couple pipes, that would end up dropping the marble into a small cup. 
     We were given 3-5 pipes that had been cut in half in order for us to look through the top of the pipe to see the marible roll through. We picked a team leader to help stragdisise a plan good enough to help us succeed and finish our task.
     The teamleader told us to let the marible roll down the first few people then run over to the end of the line and hand the pipe to someone without one. We continued this until we got the marible into the cup, which took us over 10 attempts it felt like.
     My team kept dropping the marible becuase they would move to early and the marible would just roll out of the pipe. Once my team finally got the small marible into the little cup, the TA gave us a bigger marible to roll down the pipes. 
     The marible wouldn't fit the pipes because it was to big and kept getting stuck.

        This week in class were had to bring a object from home and recreate it in tinkercad. My object was a number counting thing (I forgot the name of it) but at first I thought it would be a easy object to recreate, but soon after I found out it was harder then expected.
    I spent probably the most time working on the base shape for my number counter. Then I worked on getting the right width that I wanted which was pretty easy. Soon after I worked on getting the right shapes for the numbers and the ring that sticks out of the top.
    I used a mix of two shapes to create the ring becuase the shape never came out correct and it always came out looking weird. The button that you push down in order for it to count numbers was annoying as well, becuase I kept making it too thin or too wide.
    I had a fun time recreating this object but if I could've picked a different object I would switch it for sure.

        This week we worked in groups again but this time it was kinda boring because my group didn't really talk that much. One kid in my group didn't talk at all the whole time he just kept using the box cuter to make random shapes in the cardboard.
    Another kid helped cut one thing then started cuting random stuff like the other kid, then he started making a paper air-plane. Jonah was doing the most work in the group becuase his laptop has all the measurements and instructions but he also didn't really talk.
    How can I help my team if they don't tell me how I can help, I can tell my group doesn't really like working as a group becuase they are all doing their own thing. I feel that my group members are smart but they don't like working with others, which doesn't help me.

        Working on our Rube Goldberg project was fun but was also kinda annoying. Jonah Barty did most if not all of the work while me and the others tried helping, but it still wasn’t as much work as what Jonah did. I helped brainstorm some ideas and helped develop ideas to fix a problem. 
    One kid in our group was on his phone the whole time playing video games instead of helping us. I think I spent more time trying to get him to help us than actually doing something productive. Once we finally got everyone working on something the project started moving fast. 
    We are almost done with our project we just have one more class period to finish adding stuff and to test our final project.

        We finished our project finally and we were just waiting for an opportunity to test it. In the meantime we were just checking everyone’s project, to see what people did differently. We also went into the other class to see their projects and the whole class had some really cool designs. 
    One of my friends in the other class had a counterweight system and it looked really complicated. Another group used a pulley system to lift and lower the car in order to pop the balloon. After checking out other groups we started testing and our project worked pretty well, the second time at least. 
    The first attempt failed because the needle went under the balloon instead of popping it.

        We started the class with being told the instructions and how to follow them correctly. Then each group was given a laptop which we had to take apart while also labeling and color the laptop parts. My group started off good until we ran into some annoying screws that were a pain to get out.
    It was fun taking apart a laptop until we had to put it back together. Other then disliking putting it back together I would want to do it again. During the next class we went over bioengineering it seems cool but not for me. We learned how they use their information about biology and engineering inorder to help people live a better life.
    It is cool how they use their information about biology to give us medicine and prosthetics. As much as I think we need more people to help advance these ideas, I just dont think it's what I want to do in my future.

        We did a fun challenge where we wrote down instructions on how to make a PB&J sandwhich. As we wrote down how to make a PB&J sandwhich we thought that whoever made the sandwhich faster made the best instructions. As we went on making short and straight to the point instructions no one took into consideration that we need important steps.
    We forgot to add stuff like open and close the Jelly jar or open the peanut butter jar. So when we had a volunteer, he couldn't even open the jar so it was a failed challenge. Then the teacher finally let him open the jar to see how far he could go without missing a step. One person didn't say to use a knife so he had to use his fingers to spread the jelly and peanut butter.
    I also forgot to account for cleaning up and opening the jars.

        In class we learned about Aerospace engineers and what cool stuff they build such as aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. After learning what they build we had a guest speaker tell us more information about Aerospace engineering. I thought what he was saying was pretty interesting and how everything works together in a cool manior.
    We then got into groups and started working on coming up with a design for our rocket. Using CAD we started designing the measurements for each part of our rocket. We had some good ideas but we just didn't know how to put those ideas into reality.

        After getting all of our measurements ready for each part we just forgot about our plans for the design since we didn't have the parts we had in mind. So we ended up just winging it, which didn't workout good for us. My group just made a basic jocket model, folded paper for the nose of the rocket, and used a empty coca cola bottle flipped upside down. 
    We also used cardboard for the wings of the rocket and cut them down to the same size on each side of the bottle. When we were finally finished working on the rocket it was time to launch it. After waiting for everyone else to shoot their rockets it was finally time for our's, once it took off it started spinning in circles and then crashed into the ground. 
    So our rocket design was a fail. I think the reason our rocket didn't work was because the measurements were off since we winged it and did everthing last minute. I think our rocket could've been better if everyone put forth more effort and brought more parts for our rocket.

        In class we learned about enivironmental engineering, which helps the enivironment such as helping air pollution. The next class period we had to work in groups to figure out how many candy corn would fit on a single sheet of office paper. First my group started lining up the candy corn vertically then horizontal until we reached the end of the paper then repeated that for the next row.
    I forgot what number we ended up getting but we were way off from the actual number of candy corn that could fill the paper. The number of candy corn was 222 and I think my group was in the 100s. The next class we started making water filters by using rockes, sand, and paper towels. I had to leave during the assignment so I don't really know what we were trying to achieve by making this.

        In class this week we learned about electrical engineering. They mainly work with hardware like circuits and some coding. We also learned different types of circuits like parallel circuits and series circuits. We made the circuits on CAD one parallel, one simple, and one series. The cool part about parallel circuits is the fact that if one part of it doesn't work the rest after that part still works.
    While with the series if one part doesn't work the whole thing doesn't work. While I was making the circuits on CAD I found out I was placing the resisters in the wrong spots so the LED light wouldn't glow.

        In class this week we worked on breadboards using our CAD designs. It was pretty fun for a little bit until we had to make a circuit that I had a hard time making. The goal we had to achieve was getting the LED light to glow. We had to work with a partner to achieve that goal, even with me not knowing much I still tried. We also had to use the multimeter to measure the volts and resistance. 
    Then after testing the resistance and volts we had to write down the information. Soon after I wrote down some infomation I left class early to go to the health office.

        In class this week we started talking about our final by coming up with some ideas for spaghetti bridges. Our final is based on how well we build a spaghetti bridge that can support the weight of a bucket, that is going to be hanging on the bridge by using 2 clips which are going to be attached to the bridge. Our goal is to build a bridge that is long enough so it reaches a distance of 24 inches
    and along with the long length it also needs to have a strong structure that's able to hold up a bucket with lets say 1 gallon of water. Knowing that information my group has been trying to figure out a design for our bridge that is strong but also made from a 1 material spaghetti, over a specific span, that can sustain a load. Our first design we thoought was going to do good, but after letting the glue dry
    we realized that we put to much glue on the spaghetti. While I was trying to take the spaghetti off the paper towel it broke and we didn't want to waste so we used the broken part for our new design.

        This week in class we started talking about business engineering we had to watch and take notes on what happens in shark tank. Then after we had to come up with products that dont exist yet, my group took inspiration from other products and tried to imporve them. We had to make a slip show including the basic information a product on shark tank would have and more.
    Our product was called Ediaper, it was a type of diaper with a sensor that will notify the parent when the diaper is full or needs to changed. It was a better idea on paper but once we started show casing it, it started to seem like a bad idea. I feel like our idea would be better if we had done more research on our product and what we need for it to be used by everyone.

        This week we started talking about chemical engineering we also had a challenge that went something like a lake has bromide, chlorine, and sunlight, which makes it carcinogenic. The lake also has 60 million gallons of water and the lake is used by 600 thousand people. I couldn't think of an idea although the people behind me came up with a cool solution but I forgot what it was.
    We also started making oobleck on friday, it was pretty fun to make and mess around with but it got everywhere. It got in my partner's backpack and laptop which sucked to get out. Afterwards it was pretty easy to clean up though so that wasn't to bad thankfully.
